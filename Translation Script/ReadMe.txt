Thank you for checking out this program. A lot of dead braincells went into making this.
Heres the quick rundown:

Run Translation Program.exe. A Messagebox will appear on every initial start. Just click ok to get rid of it. Now everytime you copy something a new Messagebox will apear with the translated text. 
This program works well with visual novels and some kind of plugin that automatically copies the text on screen.
To close the program:
First close all Messageboxes then press Control+j. This can be changed to whatever if you know your way around Autohotkey. Check Translate Program.ahk
Changing the language: Open Translate.ahk with any text edito of your choice and change "LangIn" and "LangOut" correspondingly. "LangIn" is the language of the original text and "LangOut" the language it is meant to be translated to.
You need to know the language codes. 

The Text is translated with Google Translator so expect some bad grammar and broken sentences, but for getting a basic understading of what is being said.
 
Please keep in mind that this Program was made in my free time to make my life easier. It may contain bugs and may not work properly sometimes. 
Feel free to improve it on your own. 


Also i want to credit the AutoHotkey community that provided me with the pieces to put together this program and
Benny-D from which i got the core translation script.
